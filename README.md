# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules.

## 🚀 Features

- **Fast Development**: Vite's fast build and hot module replacement (HMR) provide a smooth and speedy development experience.
- **React Support**: Out-of-the-box support for React, allowing you to create modern frontend applications.
- **ESLint Rules**: Pre-configured ESLint setup to maintain code quality and standards.

## 🔧 Available Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available for React in Vite:

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**  
  Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for fast refresh and JSX transformation.
  
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**  
  Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) (a faster JavaScript/TypeScript compiler) for fast refresh and JSX transformation.
